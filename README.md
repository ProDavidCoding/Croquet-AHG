
First of all, thank you for purchasing my services.

Most of what has been done is explained in the delivery details. I will now explain how to edit and configure some aspects of the game to your liking.

Changing the sound: just import the new soud file and replace it with the existing file. Please make sure that it has the same name!
Changing the models: same thing, import your own custom models with the same name as the ones in place before them

Found a bug? I can miss bugs, so please let me know if you find one.

The waiting room: You can redirect users to your main page or Croquet experience. Insert the link to the page in the wr_link variable on line 41

Before uploading the files:

The game runs on a url based system, so in lines 46-43, you need to put in the url of the place where the game is uploaded. Just replace the [URL] brakets with the url.

    Eg. url = croquet.io/game
                Replace: [URL]/index.html -> croquet.io/game/index.html

NOTE: You need to inset your Croquet App id and API key on lines 1743 and 1744

The launch is the same as last time if you have followed all of the ubove steps.
